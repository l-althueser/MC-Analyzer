# Monte Carlo Analyzer
Data analysis tool for Geant4 simulation data. The *MC-Analyzer* is used for doing data processing of simulation data generated by [*MuensterTPC-MC*](https://github.com/l-althueser/MuensterTPC-Simulation) or XENON1T-MC. This software stands under the BSD license (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md)).

## Installation Prerequisites
This software is only tested and intended for use with Linux (or Windows Subsystem for Linux). Various incompatibilities can occur on other operation systems. The *MuensterTPC-Simulation-Analyzer* is an extended macro for the [*Data Analysis Framework ROOT*](https://root.cern.ch/) and thus requires an installation of ROOT.  
  
The installation of ROOT can be checked by running it in the terminal, just type:
```
root
```
If the ROOT environment is started you can continue reading, otherwise a proper installation of ROOT is needed.  

## Installing the MC-Analyzer
There are two ways to install this little software. Option one is to use the GitHub interface to download and extract the master branch to a specific directory ([download link](https://github.com/l-althueser/MC-Analyzer/archive/master.zip)). Option two will follow the real GitHub way of doing this ..  

First `cd` to the folder you want the Analyzer to be installed. Then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/l-althueser/MC-Analyzer.git
```

## MC-Analyzer Tutorial
This section assumes that the MC-Analyzer is installed and all prerequisites are given.  

To start the Analyzer `cd` to the installation directory and type:
```
root
.x MC-Analyzer.cc+
```
Now an interface asking for the report file should be shown. Just follow the given instructions.

### The output file/file format
You can simply view the generated simulation data with any version of [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/). Just type ..
```
root
new TBrowser
```
.. and navigate to the generated `events.root` file. Now you can do the normal click and drag routine of ROOT.  

The input data file has an specific file format which is described in the following.
#### Top directory
